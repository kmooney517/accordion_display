Making an accordion style menu with javascript, jQuery, and CSS animations:

Built a jQuery Accordion WITHOUT using slideUp, slideDown, or slideToggle. Used addClass & removeClass.
Only CSS3 transitions were allowed. It works for three sections - or more if added.
Each paragraph in each section of the accordion is a different length. This was to work with content of different lengths - but still showing similar styling.
